The A-instruction - A for addressing
Syntax: @value
    - Non-negative constant
    - Symbol referring to a constant
    - Sets the A register to value
    - RAM[A] becomes the selected RAM register
Ex:
    - @21
    - RAM[21] becomes the selected RAM register

    - @100 // Sets A to 100
    - M=-1 // Sets RAM[100] to -1

    - @# sets the RAM[#] to the active register
    - Then M is the active register so M=D sets RAM[#] to D
    - and A is still # since the value in A is an address

The C-instruction
Syntax: dest = comp ; jump //dest & jump are optional
        comp can = a ton...look it up
        dest can = null, M, D, MD, A, AM, AD, AMD
        // M refers to RAM[A]
        jump can = null, JGT, JEQ, JGE, JLT, JNE, JLE, JMP
